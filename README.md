*BjornCocaine is a forked project intended to extend the capabilities of the original repository for real-world scenarios and more complex setups. This repository is not the original and is tailored for expanded use cases.
**For the original experience (e.g., Pi Zero with e-Paper HAT), please refer to the original repository.***


## 📄 Introduction

Bjorn is a powerful tool designed to perform comprehensive network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and offensive security tasks. This fork builds upon the original tool to:

Run on any Raspberry Pi device.

Extend capabilities for real-world red team scenarios.

Address community-requested features and additions.

Note: Testing and development for this fork are conducted on a Raspberry Pi 4 B (8GB RAM). While the fork aims for compatibility across devices, the Pi 4 serves as the baseline.


## 🌟 Purposes and Motivations

***Make Bjorn run on any Raspberry Pi device, regardless of the attached screen.***

*Extend capabilities to address realistic red team use cases.*

*Incorporate solutions for community-reported issues and requested features.*


## 🌟 Features

**Network Scanning:** Identifies live hosts and open ports on the network.

**Vulnerability Assessment:** Performs vulnerability scans using Nmap and other tools.

**System Attacks:** Conducts brute-force attacks on various services (FTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, Telnet, SQL).

**File Stealing:** Extracts data from vulnerable services.

**User Interface:** Operates seamlessly without requiring an attached screen.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 📋 Prerequisites

A Raspberry Pi device (Pi 4 B recommended for optimal performance).

Proper networking setup (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).

Raspberry Pi OS installed.

System: 32-bit or 64-bit.

Kernel version: 6.6.

Debian version: 12 (Bookworm).

Working versions I tested (Raspberry Pi4B):

64BITS https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_arm64/images/raspios_lite_arm64-2024-10-28/

32BITS https://downloads.raspberrypi.com/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2024-10-28/

### 🔨 Installation

**AUTO:**

Give e good amount of Cocaine and automatic install this version using bash commands below :

Please remember to use only the first Option (1. None) When installing, otherwise problems will happen since only that option is fully tested.


```bash
# Download and run the installer
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackCocaine/Bjorn/refs/heads/main/install_bjorn.sh
sudo chmod +x install_bjorn.sh && sudo ./install_bjorn.sh
# Choose the choice 1 for automatic installation. It may take a while as a lot of packages and modules will be installed. You must reboot at the end.
```


**MANUAL:** 
- Install a clean OS from above in your PI MicroSD
- Run installation script from Original creator | [Installation](https://github.com/infinition/Bjorn?tab=readme-ov-file#-prerequisites)
- Select a random screen (If you don't have one of the supported ones)
- Replace following files:

|Files to replace|
|-|
|shared.py
|epd_helper.py|
|Bjorn.py|
|/resourcs/waveshare_epd/epdconfig.py| 
|/web/index.html|
|webapp.py|
-----------------------------------------------------------
 In your config file, set epd type to none:

|(**shared_config.json**)|
|-|
| "epd_type": "none" |

You will find all on your directories:

## ⚡ HELP?

For **detailed information** about **troubleshooting** go to original [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

Known Issues:
- **Screen support has been disabled completely and WebUI is the main interface you will use**, this is until I can make an universal adaptable screen support script.
- It seems to be some trouble generating logs for the tool, in order to address them and for further extension, I created a "**LOGS**" **button on the WebUI.**
- SSH Only working through Wi-Fi or Ethernet (For Pi4 seems to be a problem with usb driver).

## 💡 Usage Example

Here's a demonstration of how Bjorn autonomously hunts through your network like a Viking raider (fake demo for illustration):

```bash
